## Summary

I'm veteran Ruby and Rails developer with deep experience in both the technologies and practices of the Rails community. I've been working with Rails since 2005.

I am a devoted and passionate learner, constantly exploring and learning on my own in order to keep up to date in the field. I feel this serves me well in being able to adapt to new projects and environments. I regularly attend relevant conferences to continually sharpen my skills, and read voraciously on a wide variety of technical topics.

I value outstanding user experiences and have experience creating these at all levels of an app, from interface design to caching & performance tuning.

## Availability

I choose to spend 1-2 days per week with my two children and as such require a schedule of approximately 3 to 3 1/2 working days per week. I typically work about 30 hours per week. I'm unable to relocate away from Madison but have a record of successful remote work. The time spent away from the keyboard means I can truly focus when I am there, I find my productivity is not too far off of what many accomplish in 40 hours.
