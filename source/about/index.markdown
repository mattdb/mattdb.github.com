mattdb refers to Matt (D) Bauer. I'm a Ruby/Rails developer living in Madison, Wisconsin. 

Funny story about why I use the 'D' in my name: I was sitting in a session at the first RailsConf in 2006 and a person sits down in the chair next to me. I turn to greet him while simultaneously looking at his name badge for his name. "Matt Bauer" it says. I actually take a moment to double check that I still have my name badge and this isn't some pickpocket-y sort of prank. Turns out that the other Matt Bauer grew up in Madison and now lives in the Twin Cities (MN). *I* grew up in the Twin Cities and now live in Madison. Confusing! I figure the "other" Matt claimed the right to the use of the name in the Rails community without the initial due to the fact that he was one of the coauthors on _The Rails Way_.  Maybe someday I'll straight-up author a book and thus reclaim the title. Bring it!

If you'd like to learn more about my work history and/or you're interested in hiring me, you might want to take a look at [github](https://github.com/mattdb/) or my [resum&eacute;](/resume/).
