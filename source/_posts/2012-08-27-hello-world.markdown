> Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt


You've been warned.


## The Plan

I've resisted blogging recently because of an inordinate number of started-in-good-intentions-then-abandoned-after-a-month sort of efforts. Until I could convince myself I wasn't going to repeat said mistakes, it was better to stay silent.

"This time will be different"-- why? Well, I've actually gotten a plan for a series of articles that should hold my interest sufficiently to at least build some sort of critical mass of posts. That's the plan anyhow. Otherwise I guess I'll have removed all doubt.
